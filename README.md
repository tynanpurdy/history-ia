My IB History HL Internal Assignment

## Citations
Citations are done in Chicago style V16 using BibLaTeX and the Biber backend. Inline citations should be done using ```\footcite{}``` rather than ```\cite{}```. For citations to display properly, first compile .tex with pdflatex, then compile .bib with biber, and compile .tex again. After that everything works normally.
